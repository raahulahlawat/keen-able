            Born out of a necessity, FL started in 2006.
            Our parent, Open Source IT Consulting company, Keen and Able (KNA), had a consistent need to find relevant

            are unable to instil the skills, depth, initiative and application required by people in their careers. We
            were confident that since we knew what customers needed, we would be able to impart practicality to the
            learning process and prepare people who are ready to work in the real world out there...
